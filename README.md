# Database Partitioning - Horizontal Fragmentation and Query Processor

In this repository, I have simulated **Data Partitioning** approaches on top of an open source relational database management system (**PostgreSQL**) and built a simplified **Query Processor** to access data from the generated partitions, as part of the Distributed Database Systems coursework. 

**Input Data:** 
* Movie Rating data set collected from the MovieLens web site (http://movielens.org)

**Functions Implemented:**

* Loading data from a file to a database table
* Range Partition
* Round-Robin Partition
* Range Insert - Inserting data to a Range partition
* Round-Robin Insert - Inserting data to a Round-Robin partition
* Range Query
* Point Query
